# Escape from Pleasantville - level 5

Level 5 is part of 'Escape from Pleasantville', a group coding project in which myself and five other teammates each created a level that makes up an entire game. This was created as part of Hyper Island's exploring code module, wherein we were encouraged to experiment with new technologies and think about aspects of the web experience that weren't necessarily related to code.

Escape from Pleasantville is a story of the missing Alex, told through a series of postcards. You're on a mission to find out just what happened to them, and the trail has led you to a bizarre little town called Pleasantville.

Now, at the end of your journey, you can't wait to get out and get home...
